# Poem By text-davinci-002

In the moment

I am alive

I am present

I am here

I am now

In the moment

I am free

I am open

I am vulnerable

I am alive

In the moment
...

I am

I am


# Poem By text-curie-001

When I was young and carefree

I would wander around and play

Until I would get tired and need to rest

My mom would always be there

To take me home and give me a hug

Now I'm an adult and I'm all grown up

And I still love to wander and play

But now I do it with my loved ones by my side

We'll always be there to take care of me

# Poem By text-babbage-001

Once upon a time

There was a land of peace

And everything was just fine

Until someone came and changed everything

And now we're all in trouble

Because we can't rely on anyone

And we can't rely on ourselves

We need someone to help us

Someone to guide us

Someone to help us find our way

Someone to show us the way

And we'll always be looking for someone
...

Someone to help us make a change

Someone to show us the way

# Poem By text-ada-001

The sky is blue, 

And the stars are shining,

And the sun is shining,

And everything is right

In the world, in my mind

The air smells sweet,

And I feel so alive,

In my heart I know that I am whole

And everything is well

In this moment I am happy,

And I know that I am alive,

And I feel so good,

In my heart I know that I am whole


And everything is well

In this moment I am happy,

And I know that I am alive,

And I feel so good,

In my heart I know that I am whole
